# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

- V. Isualize has given us a new assignment. We are to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Using the information we created he would like us to explain how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

### What we found

The Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data:

-The Summary Data Frame show the differences in total rides, total drivers, toal fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver among three city types rural, suburban, and urban. Looking at total rides we see that the vast majority rides taken are taken in urban areas, followed by suburban and then rural cities. This trend follows ith total drivers, and total fare categories, where urban is the highest suburban is the next highest and rurual is the lowest. Next looking at average fare per ride we see that the cost per ride taken is the exact opposite of the previous sections trends where rural is the most expensie followed by suburban, then urban. Our final column is average fare per driver. Which again folows the same trend as teh average fare per ride, with rural being the highest then suburban followed by rural with the lowest averave fare per driver.

                    Rides to driver ratios: Rural 1.6 to 1 |  Suburban: 1.3 to 1 |  Urban .07 to 1

- Further analysis of this information shows that drivers in rural areas have more rides per driver than any other city type. This on top of the fact that they recieve a higher fare per ride leads to an increased incentive to drive for ride share in the rural areas. These trends follow true with suburban type of cities having the middle amount of incentive with middle average fare per ride and driver. The urban cities have the lowest incentive to drive with the lowest average fare per ride and per driver.

- The Total Fare by City Type graph shows us a line graph of total fares per day by city over the span of approximately four months. This graph shows us that the total amount of money earned per day by city type is realtively constant. There are no single day where the total fare for any city category changes its rank. they fare per city type also stays relatively consistnent but there is a small about of growth in each city type's total fare's over time.



## Summary

### Our recommendations

- The company needs to make sure that there are adequate supply of drivers in order to fulfill the requests of the passengers in this business. Long wait times and no available drivers lead to customers losing value in this product. I would stuggest further incentivising rurual divers as they have the lowest ratio of drivers to rides. This would be in effort to expand the rural market as they have the largest chance of having large wait times or no drivers available for rides. Thought there is an increased incentive to drive in the urban areas over all other city types there is still the lowest ratio of drivers to rides. It seems that the supply and demand factors have stabilized incentives across city type as the supply of drivers relative to demand for rides is low in rural cities, moderate in suburban cities, and high in urban cities. It seems important to push increased incentive where driver supply is low relative to demand inorder to supply enough drivers for customers.

- Another recommendation to consider would be to decrease incentive for drivers in urban areas as the excess amount of available drivers makes it so each individual driver is not guaranted a ride as there are more drivers than rides given in these areas. This could lead to drivers exiting the market entirely as they are not earning any money while they are available.

to combat both of these problems a third suggestion we have come up with a third suggestion

- create a drive in the country campaign where you would increase the incentive for drivers to drive in rural areas. This could be an increase in fare share for the driver. Re-imbursment for a certain percentage or amount of gas for these drivers. Increase other benifits such as health care, retirement plans, etc...  so that these drivers recieve increased incentive to drive in rural cities thus balancing the supply issue.

-- Other factors also come into play in regard to incentive driving supply and demand as one would expect large trip time and trip distance in rural cities leading to higher fuel costs and higher time spent driving. Continuing this trend we would expect moderate trip time and trip distance in suburban cities leading to moderate fuel costs and higher time spent driving and urban cities would expect these values to be the lowest. Further analysis of driving times and costs per drive would need to be conducted to fully investigate this matter.
